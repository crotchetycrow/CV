## Jack Hooper

Budding full-stack junior developer in the making at one of the leading software development bootcamps in the UK. Coming from a very Social Science background, what I lack in science experience, I make up for in desire to learn and an enthusiasm for problem solving.

## Experience

**Peabody** (October 2018 to February 2021)  
_New Homes Officer_

This role was a far cry from the career I plan to go into. It was a very hands on defect inspection role with a strong customer facing aspect that saw most of my time out of the office on construction sites. However, there are some things that I believe are relevant to a junior developer role:

  **Collaboration:** This was paramount to my role and is key aspect of my work ethic. My time was spent collaborating with both internal and external stakeholders on several large projects.
  During my first year in this role, my team and I work closely to increase our annual KPIs, with me spearheading projects to improve client resources and overall experience.

  **Organisation and time management:** My role came with an independent schedule, I was in control of my meetings and workload. During busy periods, I would have to manage not only my own workload expectations but the expectations of others.
  In addition to my regular duties I committed my time to side projects that would help streamline my work process, fitting these in alongside my regular work schedule meant creating my own deadlines, setting frequent goals/checkpoints to ensure that the projects were completed in a timely manner

  **Attention to detail:** To ensure that the final product for my clients was to the highest standard, I was responsible for setting the standard of snagging that would be used throughout the development phase. Anything missed in that initial snag could result in a poor end product. This required me to be meticulous with my inspection and maintain a good working knowledge in different elements of construction, so I could better identify when an issue arises.


## Skills

**Team working**
I pride myself in my ability to work well in a team. A skill I've worked to improve in several areas of my life. I believe collaborating with others is a useful and effective way to problem solve, it also proves a good opportunity to increase personal understanding.

- _Esports tournament (2016 - 2017)_
  •	I participated and in several national eSports tournaments leading a team in a co-operative, team-based game.

	•	My approach as team captain was to encourage regular meetings to discuss strategy and develop our overall communication as a team to improve team cohesion.

	•	As shot-caller, decisions had to be made correctly without hesitation as any mistake could lead to a loss for the team

	•	Mediating between conflicting personalities, encouraging open discussion and friendly team building games to resolve the conflict

- _Akido (2015 - 2017)_
  •	This role allowed me to test my teamwork and leadership skills through communication and collaboration

	•	Successfully increased membership numbers from previous years and keep them steady due to positive representation at key events and collaborating with the team, listening and implementing good strategies

	•	Liaising with instructors to organise grading events or demonstrations to ensure these events ran smoothly

**Problem solving**
Resilience and innovation are two vital components of problem solving. I believe that with these two traits, I am able to overcome adversity and achieve results.

- _Video editing_
  I spearheaded a project to increase client resources in which I filmed, narrated and edited and informative video to improve my clients' experience. I overcame obscure issues through creative use of Adobe tools and substituting inexperience for creativity, but using the failed results as learning tool to isolate the issues further and deepening my understanding.

- _Improving team training_
  I sought to improve on the training new starters received in my team. I identified the key areas that weren't clear to me as a new starter and and created a comprehensive guide detailing each aspect of the role. Areas in which I wasn't knowledgeable involved me collaborating with different teams to further build upon my own knowledge and translate that to my project

- _PC building, general hardware issues_
  Building a PC is akin to puzzling, it requires patience and resilience. Rushing the process and making a mistake will set you back and even damage sensitive components if you aren't careful. The difficult part of PC building is the wiring - cable management. My approach in tackling the problem of efficient cable management involves pre-planning and careful consideration.

- _Language learning_
  Language is a an important tool of communication and communication is a fundamental skill in achieving results. I consider myself to have an affinity for learning languages, by having a near native speaking level in Spanish, a conversational level in German and an elementary level in Japanese. I have learnt to appreciate the differences between how these languages communicate. Since exploring programming languages like Ruby and Python I have tried to apply what I know about language to overcome the considerable difference between programming language and spoken language.
